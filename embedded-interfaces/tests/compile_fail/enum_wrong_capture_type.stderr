  = help: the following other types implement trait `From<T>`:
            `i16` implements `From<bool>`
            `i16` implements `From<i8>`
            `i16` implements `From<u8>`
  = note: required for `u16` to implement `Into<i16>`
  = note: this error originates in the macro `interface_objects` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
