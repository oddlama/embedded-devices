## Quick start

To use this driver crate, first add it to your dependencies and select the
devices you need. You can also enable `all-devices`, but expect longer compile
times in that case.

```bash
cargo add embedded-devices -F bosch-bme280
```

If you have not disabled the `sync` or `async` create features, you will now
have access to the `BME280` device driver in either variant. Here's an example
showing how to use the driver in an async context. The `BME280Sync` variant works
exactly the same, just without calling `.await`:

```rust
// Create a device on the given interface and address
let mut bme280 = BME280Async::new_i2c(delay, i2c, Address::Primary);

// Initializes (resets) the device and makes sure we can communicate
bme280.init().await?;

// Configure certain device parameters
bme280.configure(Configuration {
    temperature_oversampling: Oversampling::X_16,
    pressure_oversampling: Oversampling::X_16,
    humidity_oversampling: Oversampling::X_16,
    iir_filter: IIRFilter::Disabled,
}).await?;

// Measure now
let measurement = bme280.measure().await.unwrap();

// Retrieve the returned temperature as Â°C, pressure in Pa and humidity in %RH
let temp = measurement.temperature.get::<degree_celsius>();
let pressure = measurement.pressure.expect("should be enabled").get::<pascal>();
let humidity = measurement.humidity.expect("should be enabled").get::<percent>();
println!("Current measurement: {:?}Â°C, {:?} Pa, {:?}%RH", temp, pressure, humidity);
```

Generally, this crate never calls `.unwrap()` or other potentially panicking
functions internally. All errors are propagated to the user, please make sure
to handle them properly! When using this driver in a real-world application,
you will be able to recover from errors at runtime or at least log what
happened.

If you are a driver developer you can also enable the `trace-communication`
feature to have all device communication logged in a verbose format for
debugging purposes:

## Writing new device drivers

Driver implementations are organized based on the manufacturer name and device
name. Each driver exposes a struct with the name of the device, for example
`BME280`, which automatically get translated into a `BME280Sync` and
`BME280Async` variant.

Usually the device owns an interface for communication. There are no further
restrictions on the struct, so if it requires multiple interfaces or extra
pins, then this is of course possible.

Most devices will expose a `new_i2c` and/or `new_spi` function to construct the
appropriate object given an interface (and address if required).

### Codecs

The vast majority of devices use similar "protocols" on top of I2C or SPI to
expose their registers - which we call codecs. For both I2C and SPI we provide
a `StandardCodec` implementation, that should allow communication with most of
the register based devices in existence. Custom codecs can easily be added if a
device requires a more complex codec.

### Register based devices

The [embedded-interfaces](https://docs.rs/embedded-interfaces/latest/embedded_interfaces/)
crate provides a simple way to define bit-packed registers, as well as an
interface implementation to allow reading and writing those registers via I2C
or SPI.

A register usually refers to a specific memory address (or consecutive memory
region) on the device by specifiying its start address. We also associate each
register to a specific device by specifying a marker trait. This prevents the
generated API from accepting registers of unrelated devices. In the following,
we'll have a short look at how to define and work with register based devices.

### Command based devices

This framework also provides a more generic concept to interface with devices,
which are called commands. A commands is a very general concept that represents
a sequence of read, write or delay operations on the underlaying bus. A command
may take input data and may produce output data.

For each type of command, an executor needs to be defined that realizes the
execution of the associated transaction sequence on the actual bus. For an
example, have a look at any of the sensirion device drivers.

### Defining a register

First, lets start with a very simple register definition. We will later create
a device struct which we can use to read and write this register.

To define our very simple register, we will use the special `interface_objects!` macro from
[embedded-interfaces](https://docs.rs/embedded-interfaces/latest/embedded_interfaces/)
which was creates specifically for this crate to make it simple and
straight-forward to define bit-packed structs and registers.

Most devices support a burst-read/write operations, where you can begin reading
from address `A` and will automatically receive values from the consecutive
memory region until you stop reading. This means you can define registers with
a `size > 1 byte` and will get the content you expect.

Let's imagine our `MyDevice` had a 2-byte read-write register at device address
`0x42(,0x43)`, which contains two `u8` values. We can define the corresponding
register like so:

```rust
use embedded_interfaces::codegen::interface_objects;

interface_objects! {
    // We specify the default codecs used by our device
    register_defaults {
        codec_error = (),
        i2c_codec = embedded_interfaces::registers::i2c::codecs::OneByteRegAddrCodec,
        spi_codec = embedded_interfaces::registers::spi::codecs::unsupported_codec::UnsupportedCodec::<()>,
    }

    // This marks any registers defined in this macro as compatible with our device
    register_devices [ MyDevice ]

    /// You can later insert the explanation for this register from the datasheet.
    register ValueRegister(addr=0x42, mode=rw, size=2) {
        /// Insert explanation of this value from the datasheet.
        width: u8,
        /// Insert explanation of this value from the datasheet.
        height: u8,
    }
}
```

This macro generates two structs: `ValueRegister` (the packed representation)
and `ValueRegisterUnpacked` (the unpacked representation). The former will only
contain a byte array `[u8; N]` to store the packed register contents, and the
latter will have the unpacked fields as we defined them. Usually we will
interface with a device using the packed data representation which can be
transferred over the bus almost as-is. Each field will automatically get
accessor functions with which you may read or write them without incurring the
overhead for full (de-)serialization.

The given codec provides then necessary information about the protocol that is
needed to access the register on a certain bus. It can determine how the
register address is used on the wire and could do extra checks like CRC
checksums.

### Accessing a register

After defining a register, we may access it through `MyDevice`:

```rust
// Imagine we already have constructed a device:
let mut dev = MyDevice::new_i2c(i2c_bus /* the i2c bus from your controller */, 0x12 /* address */);
// We can now retrieve the register
let mut reg = dev.read_register::<ValueRegister>().await?;

// Unpack a specific field from the register and print it
println!("{}", reg.read_width());
// If you need all fields (or are not bound to tight resource constraints),
// you can also unpack all fields and access them more conveniently
let data = reg.unpack();
// All representations implement Debug and defmt::Format, so you can conveniently
// print their contents
println!("{:?}", data);

// We can also change a single value
reg.write_height(190);
// Or re-pack a whole unpacked field and replace everything
reg = data.pack();

// Which we can now write back to the device, given that the register is writable.
dev.write_register(reg).await?;
```

### A more complex register

A real-world application may involve describing registers with more complex
layouts involving different data types, bit lengths or enumerations. Luckily,
all of this is fairly simple with [embedded-interfaces](https://docs.rs/embedded-interfaces/latest/embedded_interfaces/).

We also make sure to annotate all fields with `= /* default */` to allow easy
reconstruction of the power-up defaults.

```rust
use embedded_interfaces::codegen::interface_objects;

interface_objects! {
    register_defaults {
        codec_error = (),
        i2c_codec = embedded_interfaces::registers::i2c::codecs::OneByteRegAddrCodec,
        spi_codec = embedded_interfaces::registers::spi::codecs::unsupported_codec::UnsupportedCodec::<()>,
    }

    register_devices [ MyDevice ]

    /// An enum
    enum TemperatureResolution: u8{2} {
        0b00 Deg_0_5C,
        0b01 Deg_0_25C,
        0b10 Deg_0_125C,
        0b11 Deg_0_0625C,
    }

    /// A slightly more complex register
    register ComplexRegister(addr=0x44, mode=rw, size=1) {
        // Reserve 6 bits
        _: u8{6},
        /// All fields should be documented with data from the datasheet.
        /// This docstring will also be copied to all generated read/write functions
        temperature_resolution: TemperatureResolution = TemperatureResolution::Deg_0_0625C,
    }
}
```

> \[!NOTE]
> Instead of naming all registers `*Register`, in a real driver you'd likely place all registers
> in a common `registers` module for convenience and then drop the suffix.

### Defining a device

Now we also need to define our device so we can actually use the register.
Imagine our simple device would communicate over I2C only.

First of all, we create a struct for it which stores the runtime state
necessary to use our device, such as the communication interface. Additionally
we define a marker trait which we will need later to define associated
registers.

Also, we always write async code and let the `#[maybe_async_cfg::maybe]` macro
rewrite our definition twice to provide a `MyDeviceSync` and `MyDeviceAsync`
variant. All given idents are replaced with their respective sync or async
variant, too:

```rust
/// Insert description from datasheet.
#[maybe_async_cfg::maybe(
    idents(hal(sync = "embedded_hal", async = "embedded_hal_async"), RegisterInterface),
    sync(feature = "sync"),
    async(feature = "async")
)]
pub struct MyDevice<I: embedded_interfaces::registers::RegisterInterface> {
    /// The interface to communicate with the device
    interface: I,
}

pub trait MyDeviceRegister {}
```

The register interface `I` can be anything that implements the corresponding
trait from `embedded-interfaces` - which requires that the interface exposes
`read_register` and `write_register` functions. These function will later be
used to actually read or write a specific register. But before we can do that,
we still need to add a constructor to our device.

### Constructing a device

Now we need a way to create a new instance of our device given a real I2C bus
and an address. Usually we expose a `new_i2c` and/or `new_spi` function to
construct the device with the given interface.

```rust
#[maybe_async_cfg::maybe(
    idents(hal(sync = "embedded_hal", async = "embedded_hal_async"), I2cDevice),
    sync(feature = "sync"),
    async(feature = "async")
)]
impl<I> MyDevice<embedded_interfaces::i2c::I2cDevice<I, hal::i2c::SevenBitAddress>>
where
    I: hal::i2c::I2c<hal::i2c::SevenBitAddress> + hal::i2c::ErrorType,
{
    /// Initializes a new device with the given address on the specified bus.
    /// This consumes the I2C bus `I`.
    #[inline]
    pub fn new_i2c(interface: I, address: MyAddress) -> Self {
        Self {
            interface: embedded_interfaces::i2c::I2cDevice::new(interface, address.into()),
        }
    }
}
```

Here we use the `I2cDevice` interface provided by `embedded-interfaces`, which
already implements the necessary trait from above. This means we pass down the
given interface implementation plus some compile time information like the kind
of I2C address that the device uses (7/10-bit). In turn, `I2cDevice` provides a
simple interface we can use to read/write registers.

The address enum `MyAddress` should contain all valid addresses for the device,
plus a variant to allow specifying arbitrary addresses, in case the user uses
an address translation unit. The address can be any type that is convertible to
the underlying `embedded_hal::i2c::AddressMode` of the bus (7-bit or 10-bit
addressing).

### High-level device functions

Now that we have a device and a way to read or write registers, we want to
expose the `read_register` and `write_register` functions directly on our
device to make it convenient for a user to use these without first requiring
them to get the interface.

Since this is something every device will do, we again have a convenience macro
`#[forward_register_fns]` that lifts these functions into the device.

The last step - apart from defining registers - is to expose some convenience
functions for our device. The classics are things like `init`, `reset`,
`measure`, `configure` or others, but in principle you are free to write
anything that makes the device easy to use.

```rust
#[forward_register_fns]
#[maybe_async_cfg::maybe(
    idents(hal(sync = "embedded_hal", async = "embedded_hal_async"), RegisterInterface),
    sync(feature = "sync"),
    async(feature = "async")
)]
impl<I: embedded_interfaces::registers::RegisterInterface> MyDevice<I> {
    /// Initialize the sensor by verifying its device id and manufacturer id.
    /// Not mandatory, but recommended.
    pub async fn init(&mut self) -> Result<(), InitError<I::Error>> {
        use self::registers::DeviceIdRevision;
        use self::registers::ManufacturerId;

        let device_id = self.read_register::<DeviceIdRevision>().await.map_err(InitError::Bus)?;
        if device_id.read_device_id() != self::registers::DEVICE_ID_VALID {
            return Err(InitError::InvalidDeviceId);
        }

        let manufacturer_id = self.read_register::<ManufacturerId>().await.map_err(InitError::Bus)?;
        if manufacturer_id.read_manufacturer_id() != self::registers::MANUFACTURER_ID_VALID {
            return Err(InitError::InvalidManufacturerId);
        }

        Ok(())
    }
}
```

### Definining registers

For an in-depth explanation of how registers are defined and how they can be used, please
please refer to the [embedded-interfaces](https://docs.rs/embedded-interfaces/latest/embedded_interfaces/) docs.

## Device driver best-practices

When writing new device drivers, please consider the following best-practices:

- Never call any function that may `panic!`. Ever. Our drivers should not be able to crash userspace.
- Expose all registers defined in the datasheet to allow accessing all device functions, only define functions for functionality
- If the device is a sensor:
  - Create a `Measurement` struct (singular!) that holds all values measured
      by the sensor. Implement the relevant `*Measurement` traits.
  - Implement the `Sensor` trait and all relevant subtraits (e.g. `TemperatureSensor`)
